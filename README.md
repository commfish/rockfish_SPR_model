**Spawning Potential Ratios (SPR)**

Definition - the ratio of the amount of spawn produced by a cohort over its lifespan under a specific fishing regime relative to the spawm of the same population if it were not fished.  

Key points - a cohort can only get smaller over its lifetime (*M* & *F*), spawn is defined as either the number of eggs or spawning stock biomass.  Spawn with fishing will always be lower than spawn without fishing.

SPR is a ratio between 0 and 1 and expressed as a percentage e.g., 40%SPR  

To calculate use life history schedules  


| Age | Weight | Maturity | Fecundity | *M* | *F*|
